 Hi, I’m Najzon Weaver, an aspiring software developer from Detroit, Michigan. With a background in working at the post office for the past 4 years, I’ve developed a strong work ethic and attention to detail. Recently, I discovered my curiosity and passion for computer science and software development, and I’m excited to embark on this new journey.

My interest in coding began with a desire to understand how technology works and to create innovative solutions. Since then, I’ve been dedicated to building my knowledge and honing my craft. I enjoy learning new programming languages and exploring the latest tech trends, always eager to take on new challenges.

I thrive in collaborative environments where I can contribute to exciting projects and grow alongside talented individuals. In my free time, I love participating in coding challenges, connecting with the developer community, and continuously expanding my skill set.

I’m enthusiastic about the endless possibilities in software development and look forward to making a positive impact through my work.
