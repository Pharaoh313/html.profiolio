<p>I still remember to this day when my brother first brough this on dvd. I watched this movie so much it became part of my night routine.</p>

<h3>Grown Ups 2</h3>

<p>This movie to me is a classic. I never watch any of Adam's standups but he is definitely on of my favorite comedians of all time. I would love for them to make a 4th edition to the series.</p>

<h3>Furious 7</h3>

<p>Man this movie really good but also sad knowing what happened to Paul Walker</p>
